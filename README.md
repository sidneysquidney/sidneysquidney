# 🙋‍ Hi there! 

## ⛰ Coding Journey

🐍 I am a self-taught Developer, interested in app development and strategy games. Over lockdown I learnt Pyhton, Javascript, flutter and more. I'm really enjoying the whole process and can't wait to see where my coding journey takes me. 

🏰 I currently work as an apprentice full-stack developer for Minotaur Software Ltd. The work is challenging and enjoyable, and I am constantly learning new things. We use Visual Basic, C#, flutter, Javascript, and SQL.

## 🐐 Personal Note

⚽ I enjoy sports (I also have a love-apathy relationship with Manchester United), strategy, history, public speaking, and meditation.

🎩 Right now I'm trying to memorise my favourite quotes from two of my recent idols - JRR Tolkein, and Abrahan Lincoln. Here's one for size "I don't like that man. I must get to know him better."
