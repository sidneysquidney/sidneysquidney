# 🙋‍ Hi there! 

## ⛰ Coding Journey

🐍 I am a self-taught Python Programmer, with main focus on Back-End Software Engineering. Over lockdown I learnt Pyhton, SQL, HTML & CSS, Flask, Computer Architecture, and various Modules. I'm really enjoying the whole process and can't wait to see where my coding journey takes me. 

🏰 I currently work as a tennis coach, personal trainer, and musician, but am excited and ready to take the plunge into a completely new career. Being self-taught, I'm aware there's a lot I don't know, but at the same time I am confident in my ability to learn new skills and adapt to new environments.

## 🐐 Personal Note

⚽ I enjoy sports (I also have a love-apathy relationship with Manchester United), strategy, history, public speaking, and meditation.

🎩 Right now I'm trying to memorise my favourite quotes from two of my recent idols - JRR Tolkein, and Abrahan Lincoln. Here's one for size "I don't like that man. I must get to know him better."
